abstract="Numerical models can help to push forward the knowledge about complex dynamic physical systems. Modern approaches employ detailed mathematical models, taking into consideration inherent uncertainties on input parameters (phenomenological parameters or boundary and initial conditions, among others). Particle-laden flows are complex physical systems found in nature, generated due to the (possible small) spatial variation on the fluid density promoted by the carried particles. They are one of the main mechanisms responsible for the deposition of sediments on the seabed. A detailed understanding of particle-laden flows, often referred to as turbidity currents, helps geologists to understand the mechanisms that give rise to reservoirs, strategic in oil exploration. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides a rational framework to assist in this task, by combining sophisticated computational models with a probabilistic perspective in order to deepen the knowledge about the physics of the problem and to access the reliability of the results obtained with numerical simulations. This work presents a stochastic analysis of sediment deposition resulting from a turbidity current considering uncertainties on the initial sediment concentrations and particles settling velocities. The statistical moments of the deposition mapping, like other important features of the currents, are approximated by a Sparse Grid Stochastic Collocation method that employ a parallel flow solver for the solution of the deterministic problems associated to the grid points. The whole procedure is supported and steered by a scientific workflow management engine designed for high performance computer applications.",

abstract="Nowadays, more and more computer-based scientific experiments need to handle massive amounts of data. Their data processing consists of multiple computational steps and dependencies within them. A data-intensive scientific workflow is useful for modeling such process. Since the sequential execution of data-intensive scientific workflows may take much time, Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) should enable the parallel execution of data-intensive scientific workflows and exploit the resources distributed in different infrastructures such as grid and cloud. This paper provides a survey of data-intensive scientific workflow management in SWfMSs and their parallelization techniques. Based on a SWfMS functional architecture, we give a comparative analysis of the existing solutions. Finally, we identify research issues for improving the execution of data-intensive scientific workflows in a multisite cloud.",

journal="Journal of Grid Computing",

pages="1--20",
abstract="This paper focuses on data-intensive workflows and addresses the problem of scheduling workflow ensembles under cost and deadline constraints in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds. Previous research in this area ignores file transfers between workflow tasks, which, as we show, often have a large impact on workflow ensemble execution. In this paper we propose and implement a simulation model for handling file transfers between tasks, featuring the ability to dynamically calculate bandwidth and supporting a configurable number of replicas, thus allowing us to simulate various levels of congestion. The resulting model is capable of representing a wide range of storage systems available on clouds: from in-memory caches (such as memcached), to distributed file systems (such as NFS servers) and cloud storage (such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage). We observe that file transfers may have a significant impact on ensemble execution; for some applications up to 90 \% of the execution time is spent on file transfers. Next, we propose and evaluate a novel scheduling algorithm that minimizes the number of transfers by taking advantage of data caching and file locality. We find that for data-intensive applications it performs better than other scheduling algorithms. Additionally, we modify the original scheduling algorithms to effectively operate in environments where file transfers take non-zero time.",

volume="10",

pages="521--552",
abstract="In the last years, scientific workflows have emerged as a fundamental abstraction for structuring and executing scientific experiments in computational environments. Scientific workflows are becoming increasingly complex and more demanding in terms of computational resources, thus requiring the usage of parallel techniques and high performance computing (HPC) environments. Meanwhile, clouds have emerged as a new paradigm where resources are virtualized and provided on demand. By using clouds, scientists have expanded beyond single parallel computers to hundreds or even thousands of virtual machines. Although the initial focus of clouds was to provide high throughput computing, clouds are already being used to provide an HPC environment where elastic resources can be instantiated on demand during the course of a scientific workflow. However, this model also raises many open, yet important, challenges such as scheduling workflow activities. Scheduling parallel scientific workflows in the cloud is a very complex task since we have to take into account many different criteria and to explore the elasticity characteristic for optimizing workflow execution. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive scheduling heuristic for parallel execution of scientific workflows in the cloud that is based on three criteria: total execution time (makespan), reliability and financial cost. Besides scheduling workflow activities based on a 3-objective cost model, this approach also scales resources up and down according to the restrictions imposed by scientists before workflow execution. This tuning is based on provenance data captured and queried at runtime. We conducted a thorough validation of our approach using a real bioinformatics workflow. The experiments were performed in SciCumulus, a cloud workflow engine for managing scientific workflow execution.",

abstract = "Abstract Cloud computing has become a buzzword in the area of high performance distributed computing as it provides on-demand access to shared pool of resources over Internet in a self-service, dynamically scalable and metered manner. Cloud computing is still in its infancy, so to reap its full benefits, much research is required across a broad array of topics. One of the important research issues which need to be focused for its efficient performance is scheduling. The goal of scheduling is to map tasks to appropriate resources that optimize one or more objectives. Scheduling in cloud computing belongs to a category of problems known as NP-hard problem due to large solution space and thus it takes a long time to find an optimal solution. There are no algorithms which may produce optimal solution within polynomial time to solve these problems. In cloud environment, it is preferable to find suboptimal solution, but in short period of time. Metaheuristic based techniques have been proved to achieve near optimal solutions within reasonable time for such problems. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey and comparative analysis of various scheduling algorithms for cloud and grid environments based on three popular metaheuristic techniques: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and two novel techniques: League Championship Algorithm (LCA) and \{BAT\} algorithm.

Numerous state of the art workflow scheduling schemes have been proposed in the literature for scheduling simple and scientific workflows in the cloud computing and this paper presents a comprehensive survey and analysis of these schemes. It illuminates the objectives of scheduling schemes in the cloud computing and provides a classification of the proposed schemes based on the type of scheduling algorithm applied in each scheme. Beside, each scheme is illustrated and a complete comparison of them is presented to highlight their objectives, properties and limitations. Finally, the concluding remarks and future research directions are provided. "

Existing studies provide different approaches to the multi-criteria Grid workflow scheduling problem, and address different variants of the problem. A profound understanding of the problem’s nature can be an important step towards more generic scheduling approaches. Based on the related work and on our own experience, we propose several novel taxonomies of the problem, considering five facets: workflow model, scheduling criteria, scheduling process, resource model, and task model. We make a survey of the existing related work, and classify it according to the proposed taxonomies, identifying the most common use cases and the areas that have not been sufficiently explored yet.
